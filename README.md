Initially I followed the laravel bootcamp to create chirper, a basic twitter clone.

I later decided I was proficient enough to redo the tutorial, this time unguided, and this is what this repo is about.

In this repo I also add a lot of personal touch and new features such as:

- Authentication with username instead of email.
- a User page
- like functionality
- follow functionality (coming soon)
- in-app notifications (coming soon)
